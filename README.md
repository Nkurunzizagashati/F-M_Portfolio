<h1>Summary of implementation</h1>

<h2>Overal implementation</h2>

To implement F&M portifolio website from mockup to codes, we have used HTML and CSS, we have used also github for collaboration hence we used different branches to make sure that we will keep the track of changes made.

Fabrice worked on Home section, header, and Skills sections.
Gasore worked on the Portfolio, contact, and footer sections.


We used google meet, and gmail for easy and effective communication.

<h2>Responsiveness implementation</h2>

To implement responsiveness for this web page, we used flex and media queries.
